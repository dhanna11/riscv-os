  -kernel bbl used to provide SBI interface for linux.

What does a minimal bootloader look like?

  RISC-V relies upon a device tree to specify the machine. virt.c details the device tree for the virt machine
  SBI helps hide implementation details.
  BBL, a machine mode shim, provides both device tree and SBI implementations. BBL maps to BIOS-ish
  BBL takes a device tree as input from another boot loader, and strips out implementation details
  BBL pauses all HARTs, the enables when safe.
  BBL sets up a PMP
  BBL handles machine mode trap handlers
  BBL jumps from machine mode to supervisor mode, then to its payload, which will be a simple ELF image
  So it's like a second-level bootloader
